<h2>Course Summary</h2>

<p>
This course will provide an overview of natural language dialogue systems. Natural language dialogue systems allow human users to interact with computers using a natural language such as English (spoken or written). This human-machine interaction takes place in the form of conversation. Natural language dialogue systems have many applications, for example, providing information, tutorial dialogue (and generally dialogue for training, e.g., leadership skills, interviewing skills, etc.), healthcare applications (e.g., virtual human interviewers that interact with people who suffer from depression or post-traumatic stress), storytelling, controlling smart homes, companions for the elderly, etc. Recently, conversational assistants (a special type of natural language dialogue systems), e.g., Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Microsoft Cortana, have become very popular. Throughout the course, students will learn about the capabilities and limitations of such systems.
</p>

<p>
The topics covered will be similar
to <a href="http://projects.ict.usc.edu/nld/cs644f18/" target="_blank">CSCI 644 Fall 2018</a> including (but not limited to):
<ul>
  <li>overview of dialogue systems</li>
  <li>dialogue corpora and annotation</li>
  <li>dialogue processing theory (e.g., speech acts and information states)</li>
  <li>dialogue systems architectures</li>
  <li>speech recognition for dialogue</li>
  <li>speech synthesis for dialogue</li>
  <li>natural language understanding for dialogue (and dialogue state tracking)</li>
  <li>natural language generation for dialogue</li>
  <li>dialogue management</li>
  <li>dialogue systems based on reinforcement learning (such as slot-filling dialogue systems)</li>
  <li>end-to-end dialogue systems (such as chatbots based on deep learning)</li>
  <li>multi-party dialogue</li>
  <li>different user types - user modelling</li>
  <li>incremental dialogue processing</li>
  <li>other types of dialogue systems (e.g., for tutoring, language learning, negotiation, elderly care)</li>
  <li>dialogue systems evaluation</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Course Format</h2>

<p>
Half of the course lecture period will be a lecture by the instructor (or guest instructors) and half will be group discussion of research papers related to a specific topic (usually the topic presented in the first half of the lecture period). These research papers will be selected before the lecture and students will have to read and review them and send in discussion questions. Group discussions will be led/co-led by one or more students. Discussion leaders will start the discussion with a short presentation on the topic. 
</p>

<p>
Students will also have to complete 2 assignments, and carry out a main project. For the assignments, students are expected to work separately. For the main project, students can select their own topic and work separately or form groups. The topic of the main project should be relevant to the course and approved by the instructor. Because the field of natural language dialogue systems advances rapidly and the state-of-the-art is continuously changing, there is no required textbook. The material will be covered through lectures and assigned readings.
