<h2>Course summary</h2>

<p>
This course covers both fundamental and cutting-edge topics in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and provides students with hands-on
experience in NLP applications in the form of programming assignments
in Python, and a group project where students have the freedom to pick
the programming tools of their choice. Students are expected to have
programming experience and either be familar with Python or
able to quickly learn it during the first assignment.
</p>

<p>
As we'll explore in the course, natural language is often ambiguous,
and machine learning is crucial to making decisions under
uncertainty. Many other tools in basic artificial intelligence (e.g.,
planning, knowledge representation and reasoning) also play a role in
understanding and responding to natural language. However, this class
is aimed at students with a general background in computer science
(i.e., you don't need to take a machine learning or AI course as a
prerequisite). We will cover the necessary machine learning and basic
AI material in this course.
</p> 

<p>
The topics covered will be similar
to <a href="http://nld.ict.usc.edu/cs544-fall2015/index.html">last
year</a> and we anticipate discussing speech processing (language
modeling, speech recognition, speech synthesis), linguistic
foundations (parts of speech, syntax, speech disfluencies, semantics,
dialogue, discourse), machine learning, and applications (information
retrieval, information extraction, machine translation, natural
language generation, dialogue systems, automated grading). There is no
required text book for the course; we will use lectures to cover the
material.  Interested students can continue their study with other
courses in USC's <a href="http://cl.usc.edu/courses.html">
computational linguistics curriculum</a>.
</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>
There will be a variety of resources used in this course to faciliate online discussion, distributing grades, and submitting coursework.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blackboard.usc.edu">Blackboard</a>: lecture slides, grades</li>
<li><a href="https://piazza.com">Piazza</a>: discussion board (first place to go to ask questions) and announcements</li>
<li><a href="https://labs.vocareum.com/main/main.php">Vocareum</a>: used for your programming assignments</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Programming assignments (3 x 20%): the grades will depend on the performance of a system and a technical report.</li>

<li>Research project (40%): this will be a group project, graded individually: 30% of the grade will depend on the project's relevance to the course, degree of difficulty, amount of work, correctness and written report. 10% of the grade will depend on a written report about projects from other groups.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Academic Conduct</strong><br/>

Plagiarism - presenting someone else's ideas as your own, either
verbatim or recast in your own words - is a serious academic offense
with serious consequences. Please familiarize yourself with the
discussion of plagiarism in <em>SCampus</em> in Part B, Section 11,
"Behavior Violating University
Standards" <a href="https://policy.usc.edu/scampus-part-b"
target="_blank">https://policy.usc.edu/scampus-part-b</a>. Other
forms of academic dishonesty are equally unacceptable.  See additional
information in <em>SCampus</em> and university policies on scientific
misconduct, <a href="http://policy.usc.edu/scientific-misconduct"
target="_blank">http://policy.usc.edu/scientific-misconduct</a>.</p>

<p>Discrimination, sexual assault, intimate partner violence,
stalking, and harassment are prohibited by the university.  You are
encouraged to report all incidents to the <em>Office of Equity and
Diversity/Title IX Office</em> <a href="http://equity.usc.edu"
target="_blank">http://equity.usc.edu</a> and/or to the <em>Department
of Public Safety</em> <a href="http://dps.usc.edu"
target="_blank">http://dps.usc.edu</a>. This is important for the
health and safety of the whole USC community. Faculty and staff must
report any information regarding an incident to the Title IX
Coordinator who will provide outreach and information to the affected
party. The sexual assault resource center
webpage <a href="http://sarc.usc.edu"
target="_blank">http://sarc.usc.edu</a> fully describes reporting
options. Relationship and Sexual Violence
Services <a href="https://studenthealth.usc.edu/sexual-assault/"
target="_blank">https://studenthealth.usc.edu/sexual-assault/</a> provides 24/7
confidential support.</p>


<p><strong>Support Systems</strong><br/>

A number of USC's schools provide support for students who need help
with scholarly writing. Check with your advisor or program staff to
find out more. Students whose primary language is not English should
check with the <em>American Language
Institute</em> <a href="http://ali.usc.edu"
target="_blank">http://ali.usc.edu</a>, which sponsors courses and
workshops specifically for international graduate students. <em>The
Office of Disability Services and
Programs</em> <a href="http://dsp.usc.edu"
target="_blank">http://dsp.usc.edu</a> provides certification for
students with disabilities and helps arrange the relevant
accommodations. If an officially declared emergency makes travel to
campus infeasible, <em>USC Emergency
Information</em> <a href="http://emergency.usc.edu"
target="_blank">http://emergency.usc.edu</a> will provide safety and
other updates, including ways in which instruction will be continued
by means of Blackboard, teleconferencing, and other technology.</p>
