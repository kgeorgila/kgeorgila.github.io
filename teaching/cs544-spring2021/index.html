<h2>Course Summary</h2>

<p>
This course covers both fundamental and cutting-edge topics in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and provides students with hands-on experience in NLP applications in the form of programming assignments. Students are expected to have programming experience and be familar with Python.
</p>

<p>
As we'll explore in the course, natural language is often ambiguous, and machine learning is crucial to making decisions under uncertainty. Many other tools in basic artificial intelligence (e.g., planning, knowledge representation and reasoning) also play a role in understanding and responding to natural language. However, this class is aimed at students with a general background in computer science (i.e., you don't need to take a machine learning or AI course as a prerequisite). We will cover the necessary machine learning and basic AI material in this course. 
</p>

<p>
The topics covered will be similar
to <a href="https://nld.ict.usc.edu/cs544-fall2016/" target="_blank">CSCI 544 Fall 2016</a> including (but not limited to):
<ul>
  <li>introduction to natural language processing</li>
  <li>corpora and annotation</li>
  <li>speech recognition</li>
  <li>speech synthesis</li>
  <li>natural language understanding (parsing and semantics)</li>
  <li>natural language generation</li>
  <li>language modeling</li>
  <li>text classification and sequence labeling</li>
  <li>discourse</li>
  <li>information retrieval and extraction</li>
  <li>machine translation</li>
  <li>dialogue systems, based on reinforcement learning and end-to-end (chatbots)</li>
  <li>deep learning</li>
  <li>evaluation</li>
  <li>educational applications</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Course Format</h2>

<p>
There will be lectures by the instructor (or guest instructors) as well as group discussions of research papers related to a specific topic. 
</p>

<p>
Students will also have to complete 3 programming assignments and a final online exam. Students are expected to work separately. Because the field of natural language processing advances rapidly and the state-of-the-art is continuously changing, there is no required textbook. The material will be covered through lectures and assigned readings.
