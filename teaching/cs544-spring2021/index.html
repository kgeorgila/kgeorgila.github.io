<h2>Course Summary</h2>

<p>
This course covers both fundamental and cutting-edge topics in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and provides students with hands-on experience in NLP applications in the form of programming assignments. Students are expected to have programming experience and be familar with Python.
</p>

<p>
As we'll explore in the course, natural language is often ambiguous, and machine learning is crucial to making decisions under uncertainty. Many other tools in basic artificial intelligence (e.g., planning, knowledge representation and reasoning) also play a role in understanding and responding to natural language. However, this class is aimed at students with a general background in computer science (i.e., you don't need to take a machine learning or AI course as a prerequisite). We will cover the necessary machine learning and basic AI material in this course. 
</p>

<p>
The topics covered will be similar
to <a href="https://nld.ict.usc.edu/cs544-fall2016/" target="_blank">CSCI 544 Fall 2016</a> including (but not limited to):
<ul>
  <li>introduction to natural language processing</li>
  <li>corpora and annotation</li>
  <li>speech recognition</li>
  <li>speech synthesis</li>
  <li>natural language understanding (parsing and semantics)</li>
  <li>natural language generation</li>
  <li>language modeling</li>
  <li>text classification and sequence labeling</li>
  <li>discourse</li>
  <li>information retrieval and extraction</li>
  <li>machine translation</li>
  <li>dialogue systems, based on reinforcement learning and end-to-end (chatbots)</li>
  <li>deep learning</li>
  <li>evaluation</li>
  <li>educational applications</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Course Format</h2>

<p>
There will be lectures by the instructor (or guest instructors) as well as group discussions of research papers related to a specific topic. 
</p>

<p>
Students will also have to complete 3 programming assignments and a final online exam. Students are expected to work separately. Because the field of natural language processing advances rapidly and the state-of-the-art is continuously changing, there is no required textbook. The material will be covered through lectures and assigned readings.
</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blackboard.usc.edu/">Blackboard</a>: lecture slides, grades and announcements</li>
<li><a href="https://piazza.com/">Piazza</a>: discussion board (first place to go to ask questions) and announcements</li>
<li><a href="https://labs.vocareum.com/main/main.php">Vocareum</a>: for programming assignments</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<ul>
  <li> 3 programming assignments - 3 x 30% </li>
  <li> final online exam - 10% </li>
</ul>  

<h2>Assignments</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Assignment 1: Due March 8th, 4pm. </li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href=assignment1/CS544-assignment1.pdf target="_blank">Desription (pdf)</a> 
    <li><a href=assignment1/report.txt target="_blank">Report template (txt)</a> 
  </ul>  
  <li> Assignment 2 </li>
  <li> Assignment 3 </li>
</ul>  

<h2>Exam</h2>

<p>
The final exam will be open-note, open-book, and taken online via Blackboard. It is strictly individual, and no collaboration is allowed.
</p>

<p>
The online final exam is due at the end of the final exam period (May 5, 4pm Pacific Time). It will be released 48 hours beforehand; students will have the flexibility to start and finish when they like as long as they submit before the deadline.   
</p>

<p>
In the lecture slides for the course, we will work through questions and problems similar to those on the exam. The best way to study for the exam is to work through the questions and problems in the lecture materials. 
</p>
