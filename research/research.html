	    <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
            My research focuses on natural language processing and artificial 
            intelligence with a particular interest in the field of machine 
            learning for natural language dialogue processing (in both 
            spoken and written forms). In natural language dialogue two or 
            more participants interact in order to exchange information, 
            perform a task, negotiate, or even for pure entertainment 
            purposes. Natural language dialogue systems allow users to 
            interact with computers using language (spoken or written) by 
            trying to simulate how humans interact with one another. 
            Due to the technological challenges they impose as well as their 
            potential for commercial exploitation, natural language dialogue 
            systems have attracted increased attention in both academia and 
            industry. Natural language dialogue systems have applications 
            in many different domains, for example, providing information, 
            command-and-control, tutorial dialogue (and generally dialogue for 
            training, e.g., leadership skills, interviewing skills, etc.), 
            healthcare applications (e.g., virtual human interviewers that 
            interact with people who suffer from depression or post-traumatic 
            stress), storytelling, controlling smart homes, 
            companions for the elderly, etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            The underlying concept behind my research work is how to learn 
            human behavior patterns from existing human-machine interaction 
            data in order to make natural language dialogue systems more 
            human-like, robust to errors and misunderstandings, and adaptive 
            to different types of human users and domains. This is an 
            iterative procedure: build a dialogue system, have the system 
            interact with humans, analyze the data from these interactions, 
            use the data from these interactions to improve the dialogue 
            system (e.g., by learning behavior patterns directly from the 
            data), and so forth. 
            <br>
            <br>
            My research interests include all aspects of natural language 
            dialogue processing with a focus on statistical dialogue management
            (reinforcement learning of dialogue policies),
            expressive conversational speech synthesis, and speech recognition.
