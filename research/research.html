	    <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
            My research focuses on natural language processing and artificial 
            intelligence with a particular interest in the field of machine 
            learning (including deep learning and deep reinforcement learning)
	    for natural language dialogue processing (including
	    spoken, written, and multimodal dialogue). 
            <br>
            <br>
            The underlying concept behind my research work is how to learn 
            human behavior patterns from existing human-human and human-machine
	    interaction data in order to make natural language dialogue
	    systems more human-like, robust to errors and misunderstandings,
	    and adaptive to different types of human users and domains. 
            <br>
            <br>
            My research interests include all aspects of natural language 
            dialogue processing with a focus on statistical dialogue management
            (deep reinforcement learning of dialogue policies), 
            expressive conversational speech synthesis, and speech recognition.
	    I also work on multi-agent modeling and intelligent tutoring
	    systems.
